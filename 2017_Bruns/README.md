GPS Coordinates: 42°44'10.9"N+106°19'05.5"W

## Measurements

Tables 5 and 6 in [1] contains all the information: Stars are identified using the Thyco catalog, distances to the Sun are expressed in units of solar radii, deflections are expressed in arcsec.

Two sets of deflection values are presented, obtained using the two analysis software programs "Astrometrica" and "MaxIm DL".

Our aggregated dataset contains the mean of the Astrometrica and the MaxIm DL results for each star.
