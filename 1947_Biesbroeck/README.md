# Biesbroeck, 1947 #

## Eclipse Date ##

20 May 1947

## Observers ##

* George Van Biesbroeck

## Observation site ##

Bocajuva, Minas Geraes, Brazil (610 m above sea level)

Coordinates: 17°12'48.9" S, 43°41'18.2 W

## Measurements

Table I in [1] contains the list of the 51 stars that were measured during the eclipse. For each star, the table shows: the identifier (based on the Bonner Durchmusterung catalogue), the distance r in solar radii from the centre of the Sun, and three sets of Y values, where Y is the ratio between the measured deviation of star delta_r (expressed in thousandths of a millimetre) and its distance r.

Table I contains also a column for a so-called X value, where X = 51.53 / r^2. However, we re-computed X using distances and we found that a couple of values were different. Since our values agree with plots shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4, it is possible that a few X values have been mistyped or switched. Hence, we ignored the original data in our analysis.
