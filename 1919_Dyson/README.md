# Dyson, 1919 #

## Eclipse Date ##

29 May 1919

## Observers ##

* Arthur Eddington and Edwin Turner Cottingham (Prı́ncipe)
* Andrew Crommelin and Charles Rundle Davidson (Sobral)
* Frank Watson Dyson

## Observation site ##

Sobral, Brazil (70 m above sea level)
Coordinates: 3°41'33" S, 40°21'18" W

Roça Sundy, São Tomé and Príncipe (150 m above sea level)

## Measurements

The calculated (expected) displacement and observed radial displacement of the individual stars are shown in [1] at page 331. The names of the stars are listed in Table I (page 293).

In our aggregated dataset, the distance from the Sun has been computed dividing the expected displacement by 1.75 (the  deflection value predicted by Einstein). Using the diagram published at page 294, the names of the star and Stellarium [2], we have been able to associate to each star its identifier in the SAO catalog.
