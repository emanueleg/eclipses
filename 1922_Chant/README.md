# Chant and Young, 1922 #

## Eclipse Date ##

September 21, 1922

## Observers ##

* Clarence Augustus Chant
* Reynold Kenneth Young

## Observation site ##

Wallal, WA, Australia (10 m above sea level)

Coordinates: 120°41'E, 19°46'S

## Measurements

Table II in [1] lists the observed stars - identified using the BD catalogue - and their distances from the center of the Sun, measured in 50 minutes of arc. The displacement (in arcseconds) and the weight associated to each measurement are presented in the table at page 284.

In our aggregated dataset, we changed the unit of distance to solar radii. Since the Sun has an angular diameter of about 32 minutes of arc, its radius is approximately 16 minutes of arc. Hence, we converted multiplied Chant's values by 50 and dividing the results by 16. Moreover, the weights have not been included.
