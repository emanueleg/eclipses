# Biesbroeck, 1952 #

## Eclipse Date ##

25 February 1952

## Authors ##

* George Van Biesbroeck

## Observation site ##

Khartoum, Sudan (380 m above sea level)

Coordinates: 15°30' N, 32°33' E

## Measurements

Tables I in [1] contain all the values: stars are identified using the Bonner Durchmusterung astrometric catalog, distances from the Sun are expressed in units of solar radii, deflections are expressed in mm.

The estimated Einstein's coefficient is provided for each combination of eclipse and check plates, both in mm and in arcsec. The conversion ratio from mm to arcsec varies from 29.28 to 29.35, depending on the plates. It is worth noting that in 1947, Biesbroeck computed the scale factor of its equipment as 29.52 (plus a small difference in scale) - hence, the ratio used in [1] are coherent with the results obtained a few years before.

Our aggregated dataset contains the mean deflection for each star in arcsec, computed over all the available measurements. Before averaging, each deflection value available has been converted from mm to arcsec using the coefficient associated. 
As mentioned above, we computed the ratio for each pair of eclipse-check plates using the values included at the end of Table I. For example, dividing E(mm) by E, we obtain 49.2/ 1.68 = 29.29 for the Ea1-Ca1 combination. Hence, the measured deflection for star #1 (BD -10 5925) for the Ea1-Ca1 plates is 7.2 mm, which correspond to 7.2 / 29.29 = 0,25".
