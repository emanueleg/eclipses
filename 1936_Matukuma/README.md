# Matukuma, 1936 #

## Eclipse Date ##

19 June 1936

## Observers ##

* Takehiko Matukuma
* A. Onuki, S. Yosida, and Y. Iwana

## Observation site ##

Koshimizu, Hokkaido, Japan

Coordinates: 43째51'4" N, 144째28'17" E

## Measurements

The measured data have been published in [1]. The table at page 55 list the observed stars, which are identified using the Astronomische Gesellschaft catalog. The distance of the observed stars from the Sun has not been included in [1]; measured deflections are expressed in arcsec and are presented in a table at page 70.

In our aggregated dataset, we have converted the id of the star from the Astronomische Gesellschaft (AG) to Bonner Durchmusterung (BD) using [2].
The dataset contains the average deflection for each star in arcsec, computed as the mean between the two available deflection values.
We used Figure 5 to measure distance from the Sun in solar radii: we transformed the original raster figure into a vector image, and we used the free software Inkscape for measuring Sun's radius and the distance of each star. The vector image is included in this archive.
